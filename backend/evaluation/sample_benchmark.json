    "question": "What are the key findings of the paper?",
    "ground_truth": "The paper introduces Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy TOPSIS methodologies for supply chain risk management, utilizing fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty in decision-making and providing a comprehensive approach to risk assessment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What methodologies does the paper propose for risk prioritization?",
    "ground_truth": "The paper proposes Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) for risk prioritization in supply chain management."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Fuzzy AHP differ from traditional AHP?",
    "ground_truth": "Fuzzy AHP incorporates fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and vagueness in expert judgments, allowing for more realistic modeling of decision-making scenarios compared to traditional AHP which uses crisp values."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main risk factors considered in the paper?",
    "ground_truth": "The paper considers risk factors including supplier reliability, financial impact, operational vulnerabilities, demand variability, and supply chain disruptions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using TOPSIS in this framework?",
    "ground_truth": "TOPSIS is used to rank alternatives by measuring their distance from the ideal and anti-ideal solutions, helping to identify the most critical risks that require immediate attention."
